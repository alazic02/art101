    <h2>Lab 10 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h2>

    <!-- lab task 1 -->
    <div id="challenges">
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>I didn't face many challenges while completing this lab (other than
				 my crippling procrastination...) as I was able to use the class slides
				 and work from Lab 9 as references on how to properly attach the event
			 	 listener to the button and make the results of the sorting function
			 	 appear in the 'output' div.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="problems">
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>There weren't many problems that we encountered, aside from a few errors
				 that came up when we were testing the button's functions. We ended up
			 	 placing all of the active parts of the lab (sorting the input, making
				 a new 'p' element, and appending it to the 'output' div) inside of the
			 	 button's eventListener function. If we didn't do that, it would give us
			 	 errors because variables inside of that function couldn't be accessed
			 	 outside of it since they were not global variables. I assume a more
				 efficient way to do it would be to have some global variables, but
			 	 since the input and sorted name didn't need to be accessed anywhere else
			 	 on the page, it didn't matter much for the purpose of this lab.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="results">
      <h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Below are the results of the lab. Input your name (or any string of
				 letters and numbers), click the button, and the input will be reordered
			 	 alphabetically as is the default for the array sort function. This new
			 	 array will then be added to the 'output' div in the index.html through
			 	 the appendChild function. If you open the console, you will be able to
			 	 see the newly-populated div printed!</p>
