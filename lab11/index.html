    <h2>Lab 11 - Libraries & jQuery</h2>

    <!-- lab task 1 -->
    <div id="challenges">
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>I didn't face too many challenges when working on this lab, other
         than feeling a bit lost when having to use jQuery. However, I was able
         to use the class slides and some referencing to Wes's class repository
         as guidance. Once I did this, understanding how to call and use jQuery
         became easier.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="problems">
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>I only experienced some minor problems during the lab, namely remembering
         to use quotation marks when referencing a div ID in jQuery and having
         to use single quotation marks when giving the new button elements an ID.
         Luckily, the console told me where the errors were, so it was a quick fix.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="results">
      <h3>Results</h3>
			<p>The results are pretty clear to see: each of these titled divs have a
         button added to them that was done completely through jQuery. Clicking
         them toggles the class 'special' in the CSS, which adds a background
         color and border style to the div. This same class has been added to
         the div containing the link to the lab's JavaScript file through jQuery.
         The console also prints a check each time one of the buttons is clicked.</p>
