    <h2>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h2>

    <!-- lab task 1 -->
    <div id="challenges">
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>One of the main challenges I experienced doing this lab was wrapping
				 my head around how modulo (%) works. Every time I've come across it
			 	 before in other classes, I've always had to remind myself that it
			 	 returns the remainder of the division, not the actual answer. The lab was
			 	 also made a bit easier because Wes had gone over it in class, and I
			 	 was able to reference their class repository for help.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="problems">
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>I didn't encounter many problems working on this lab; having the
				 screenshot in the lab instructions was helpful, and using many
			 	 console.log() calls before getting too far in to make sure commands
			 	 were working made it easy to catch errors along the way. I had wanted
			 	 to print the 'output' div in the console with the new information
			 	 added through the JavaScript like we did in Lab 9, but couldn't
			 	 figure out a way to do so without making a new variable and assigning
			 	 the div to it. Since it wasn't going to be used anywhere else, however,
			 	 I decided it wasn't necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="results">
      <h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Below are the results of the lab. Instead of going with Wes's Harry Potter
				 theme, I decided to instead go with a "American high school trope" sorter,
			 	 assigning the user to be a Nerd, Jock, Goth, or Prep depending on the
			 	 remainder. While I like Harry Potter (despite the author), because it
			 	 felt out of scope to add the same amount of description and effort that
			 	 Wes had, I decided to use something that is more superficial.</p>
