    <h2>Lab 13 - Loops</h2>

    <!-- lab task 1 -->
    <div id="challenges">
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>I didn't face a lot of challenges when working on this lab since we
				 had gone over the logic part in class, and because I already have a
			 	 basis of knowledge in these elements of programming (loops, iterating,
				 etc.). I also used the replit that Wes made during class as a guide.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="problems">
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>There weren't too many problems that I encountered, other than the jarring
				 look of all of the numbers printing on the page when it loaded appearing
				 in one big long line rather than organized neatly. As such, I added a
				 button that needs to be clicked in order for the loop to be executed,
				 and added columns to the 'output' div as instructed in the Bonus Task so
				 the printed text would be formatted.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="results">
      <h3>Results</h3>
			<p>In order to call the function that runs the for loop, the button below
				 needs to be clicked. Doing so appends all of the numbers to the 'output'
			 	 div, as well as the different words and combinations for the numbers that
				 are multiples. It also prints a "button clicked" statement to the console.</p>
    </div>

				Click to start!
