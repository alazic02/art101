      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>Overall, the challenges I’ve faced while working on these labs haven’t
				been too great, and have been easily solvable through looking at the
				lecture slides, Wes’s live coding examples, and case-by-case Googling
				for specific errors. There hasn’t been anything that has truly stumped
				me or made a lab impossible for me to figure out. Attending section and
				hearing other people’s issues and solutions was also very helpful, and
				being able to talk through processes with the other students was a good
				resource. One place I think I lack skills is in doing CSS; I’ve not
				really experimented with it a lot, and it’s usually the last thing I
				work on when doing the labs, so I haven’t been able to mess around
				with the look of my site pages as much as I would like.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="problems">
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>Any major problems I found when doing the labs have been solvable, or
				have been able to be worked around either by eliminating the trouble
				spot or finding another method of implementing what I had in mind.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="results">
      <h3>Results</h3>
			<p>In general, I’m pretty happy with how my labs and work have gone during
				this course. I’ve been able to accomplish all of the necessary tasks for
				each lab, and I’ve learned quite about shortcuts and other tools that can
				be used in web design to make things easier. For example, I had never
				used jQuery before, but it really made function calls and implementing JS
				into HTML a lot simpler to do. This class has been very unique among my
				programming class experiences, and I’ve enjoyed it a lot.</p>
