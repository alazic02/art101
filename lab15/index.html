    <h2>Lab 15 - AJAX</h2>

    <!-- lab task 1 -->
    <div id="challenges">
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>I had quite a few issues with this lab but did eventually get it working.
         My main problem was understanding how AJAX was working, and how to use
         the API. I still don't fully understand either, but through reading
         the lecture slides thoroughly and referencing Wes's JSFiddle from class,
         I was able to understand it enough to complete the lab. One major thing
         that I still do not completely get is the 'data' key for the AJAX call.
         Since Wes did not use it in class, and the slides don't fully explain it,
         my comprehension is a little spotty. However, it wasn't necessary for what
         I used for the lab.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="problems">
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>One major problem I had was a 'parseerror' that I was getting when originally
         trying to use the numbersapi. I wasn't sure what it was or where I was
         going wrong, as my code had no other errors and looked like Wes's JSFiddle
         example. After looking on Stackoverflow, though, it seemed to be an issue
         with incompatible expected data types. In class, we used the key 'dataType'
         and value of 'json' to tell the program what the data was expected to be.
         I guess the numbersapi didn't return JSON, or something else was wrong,
         but removing that line from the AJAX call fixed the error and properly
         returned the data in both the console and the 'output' div.</p>
      <p>However, once I thought I was done and pushed everything to GitHub, it
         stopped working. The numbersapi is hosted on http, and GitHub is https.
         Since there were incompatible security types, the API data could not be
         accessed. Luckily, someone in section had shared a dinosaur fact generator
         that was https, so I was able to quickly redo my code and use that URL instead.
         It was unfortunate as I had two buttons, one that called a random number fact
         and one that called a fact about a random date, and I had to scrap both.
         The unused code is commented out at the bottom of the JS file.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="results">
      <h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Clicking the button below will load a dinosaur fact from the linked API
         and add it to the output box. For some reason it doesn't always stay
         within the boundaries of the div, even though it should.</p>
