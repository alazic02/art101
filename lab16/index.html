    <div id="challenges">
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>A major challenge I faced was fully understanding what the assignment
				 meant when it said to save the data to a variable and use said variable
			 	 to add a section title and make a tag. I was a bit at a loss, but figured
			 	 out what needed to be done by referencing Wes's JSFiddle from last week.
			 	 I think my biggest source of confusion came from not really knowing where
			 	 to run the function that loaded the image and stored all this data. However,
				 seeing from Wes's example that it was kept all within the successful data
				 loading portion of the AJAX call, I was able to make it work.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="problems">
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>One issue I had was understanding what the assignment meant when it
				 asked us to add an 'alt' and 'title' attributes. I know that this meant
			 	 for us to add those pieces of information to the image's tag for the
			 	 HTML; at first, I wasn't able to figure out a way to do this successfully
			 	 while also loading a non-static image URL because attributes in a tag
			 	 need to be in double quotes. However, it turned out to have a simple
			 	 fix of using single quotes instead, and making sure to fully enclose
			 	 each attribute of the image object so that the image could still be shown.
				 It took a little trial and error, but eventually I got it working. The
				 whole tag is printed to the console to easily show the alt text.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="results">
      <h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Below is the output div that displays the most recent XKCD comic. It also
				 gets and displays the comic's title, and the console prints the entire
			 	 comic object, its title, and its tag that is appended to the div. The tag
			 	 also includes the image's title, and the alt text provided in the image object.</p>
