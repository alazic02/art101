		<h2>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h2>
			<div id="about">
				<p>This goal of this lab was to become more familiar with
				file structures and how to save and transfer files from
			 	the local machine to the GitHub server. It also focused on
				creating and editing index.html files, and having them show
				up in-browser.</p></div>

		<div id="difficulties">
			<h4>Difficulties</h4>
				<p>I didn't encounter many diffuculties during this lab
				which was nice. The only issues I encountered were fairly
				small; I had some trouble loading my photo on my homepage,
				but that was because I hadn't put in the correct file type.
				I also had a small problem making all of the changes I had
				made to the repository's index.html appear on the website,
				but I realized it was because I hadn't actually pushed any
				of the changes I had made. Once I had finished the commits
				and updates, and pushed the changes, I had no problems.</p></div>

			<h4>Results</h4>

					its contained files:</p>

				<p>This is a screenshot of the art101 index.html, both in
				Atom and as it appears on my <a href="https://alazic02.github.io/art101/">
				GitHub website</a> (not local files):</p>

				in Atom, and how it appears in-browser when showing the local file:</p>
