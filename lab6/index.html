	<!-- lab task 3 -->
	<div id="challenges">
		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>One small challenge we faced was getting the syntax correct when using
			 the console. There were some commands that didn't work the first time
		 	 when trying to declare some components of the myMainRide object.</p>
		<p>Another challenge was formatting the myTransport array when printing. We
			 ended up calling each array element to be printed individually with
			 hand-written spacing between the elements because the example statement
			 in the assignment did not add spaces when called with <i>document.writeln()</i>.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="problems">
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>When using the console, we saw that the <b>name:</b><i>value</i> pair of
			 "year" had to be defined in the myMainRide object before the "year"
		 	 number could be called as <i>myMainRide.year</i> to calculate the car's
			 "age". Therefore, just in case, we defined the "year" when declaring the
			 myMainRide object, and defined the "age" calculation separately.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="results">
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>Below is the printed results of the lab.js file. It first prints out
			 the myTransport array in a list form, and then prints out the data
		 	 held in the myMainRide object:</p>
