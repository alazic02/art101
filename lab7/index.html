		<!-- lab task 1 -->

			<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<p>We didn't face too many challenges because the example code provided
         on the lab assignment page was very helpful for figuring out how to
         write the JavaScript correctly. One thing that we did try to do was
         use repl.it to test the JavaScript code, but for some reason it wasn't
         working. This may have had something to do with the need to use the
         window.prompt() command, and perhaps only using a prompt() function
				 would have worked.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="problems">
			<h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>When running the program in repl.it, it didn't
         say there were any errors, but it didn't provide a space to give an
         input, either. When trying to call the sortUserName() function in the
         JavaScript file, it also didn't do anything, and when called in the
         console, it said that the function was not defined. However, when using
         the index.html preview page from local files, it worked and gave an output
         as expected with no errors or issues. Figuring out how to print the
				 userName input onto the image for some reason was a bigger struggle than
				 anticipated, but that was because the userName kept getting printed on
				 the script output box rather than on top of the image.</p>
