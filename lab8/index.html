    <h2>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h2>

    <!-- lab task 1 -->
    <div id="challenges">
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges we encountered in completing this lab
         was really understanding what we were doing with the map function and
         anonymous functions. While getting a handle on what map does was not
         too bad, we really struggled with understanding the syntax and meaning
         behind the way it worked together with creating an anonymous function.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="problems">
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>When testing the JavaScript in the browser console, we had some errors
         arise, but they were mostly due to misspelling our function name when
         trying to call it. We also had a lot of confusion understanding the
         correct way to write the new anonymous callback function used to map a
         new operation onto the array of numbers.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="results">
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>We weren't able to get to the Task X bonus of having the console results
         print on this page, but if you open the console in-browser, you should
         see this printed:</p>
