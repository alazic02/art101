    <h2>Lab 9 - JavaScript for the Web</h2>

    <!-- lab task 1 -->
    <div id="challenges">
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>We faced quite a few challenges when completing this lab, mostly
         related to getting the new elements we created in the lab.js to
         properly append to the 'output' div in the index.html. Because there
         were no screenshots in the lab instructions, it was even more difficult
         to troubleshoot and fix.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="problems">
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>In section, we went over a solution for appending the new elements
         that involved making the <i>new1El</i> and <i>new2El</i> variables
         assigned to the new elements into text nodes, which were then able to
         be appended onto the 'output' div. This worked because the error we were
         getting was an incompatible node type error. The HTML was not able to
         recognize the variables because they couldn't be read. However, the
         solution was a lot simpler than creating two new varibles.</p>
      <p>In order to be able to append the variables properly without being
         turned into text nodes, we had to use the <i>innerHTML</i> method. By
         using this and writing our new elements as <i>new1El.innerHTML = </i>,
         it accesses the inside of the element we made (in this case a new
         paragraph) and added the text there. Doing it this way made it so that
         the element was now fully readible for the index.html, and so could be
         appended correctly to the 'output' div.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <!-- link to lab.js file -->
      <div id="lablink">
        <p>This link opens the lab.js source code:</p>
        <p><a href="js/lab.js">Lab 9 JavaScript file</a></p>
      </div>

      <p>Below are the new paragraph elements we made in our lab.js file, and
         appended onto the 'output' div. In the index.html file, the div has no
         content.</p>
